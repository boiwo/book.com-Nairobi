A responsive navigation bar to help users easily navigate the website.

Displays a collection of books available for purchase.

Each book listing includes the book title, a short description, and an image (or placeholder if the image is missing).

Books are displayed in a grid layout for easy browsing.

3. Contact Form

A simple form that allows users to send inquiries to the bookstore.

Fields include Name, Email, Message, and a Submit button.
